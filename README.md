## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

##  ToDo List

* The Game randomly shuffles the cards. A User wins once all cards have successfully been matched
* When a user winds the game, a madal appears to congratulate the player and ask if they want to play again.
* Display the total time to win the game and the star rating.
* A restart button allows the player to reset the game board, the timer, and the start rating.
* The game displays a star rating (from 1 to at least 3) that reflects the player's performance. At the beginning of a game, it should display at least 3 stars. After some number of moves, it should change to a lower star rating. After a few more moves, it should change to a even lower star rating (down to 1).
  
  The number of moves needed to change the rating is up to you, but it should happen at some point.
  
* When the player starts a game, a displayed timer should also start. Once the player wins the game, the timer stops.
* Game displays the current number of moves a user has made.
* Application uses CSS to style components for the game.
* All application compon`__`ents are usable across modern desktop, tablet, and phone browsers.
* Comments are present and effectively explain longer code procedure when necessary.
* Code is formatted with consistent, logical, and easy-to-read formatting as described in the [Udacity JavaScript Style Guide](http://udacity.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-styleguide/javascript.html).
